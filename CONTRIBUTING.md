## Adding New Transformations

To add support for new Tailwind classes:

2. Add tests for the transformation in `tests/transform.test.js`
3. Update the documentation in README.md
4. Add an example if applicable

Example:
```javascript
// In index.js
const TAILWIND_LTR_TO_RTL_MAPPINGS = {
  // ... existing mappings
  "your-ltr-class": "your-rtl-class",
};
```
